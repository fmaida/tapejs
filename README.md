# Tape.js

By Francesco Maida.

### What is this script?

This is an experimental script that tries to use the new HTML5 audio features in order to convert MSX CAS Files into audio files that can be used with a real MSX machine. You should be able to use this script on any static HTML page and it should work from any computer, smartphone or tablet that have a modern web browser. iPhone, iPad and the vast majority of the most recent Android devices should support it.

### Dependencies

In order to generate and download a wav file this application makes use of  
[riffwave.js](http://codebase.es/riffwave/) by Pedro Ladaria and [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/) by Eli Grey.
