# Tape.js

By Francesco Maida.

### What is this script?

This is an experimental script that tries to use the new HTML5 audio features in order to convert MSX CAS Files into audio files that can be used with a real MSX machine. You should be able to use this script on any static HTML page and it should work from any computer, smartphone or tablet that have a modern web browser. iPhone, iPad and the vast majority of the most recent Android devices should support it.

### License of use

**You can freely use this script for any commercial and non-commercial purpose.** The only thing I'm asking you is to mention my name and the script name if you're going to use it on your website.

There's one other thing you have to know before diving into code: at the moment all the documentation and the variable names are written in Italian. Sorry! I'm waiting to add some necessary features and fix some bugs before considering this code enough stable to take some time and make the code more understandable for everyone else.

### Dependencies

In order to generate and download a wav file this application makes use of  
[riffwave.js](http://codebase.es/riffwave/) by Pedro Ladaria and [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/) by Eli Grey.
